# Other Features

## Clickable subreddit links.

Gauss will, in certain channels, automatically generate clickable links to mentioned subreddits.

For example, if a user mentions /r/University_of_Bayes, Gauss will respond like this:

> Here is a clickable link: https://www.reddit.com/r/University_of_Bayes

Gauss will also warn about subreddits marked as NSFW and not provide clickable links for those subreddits.
