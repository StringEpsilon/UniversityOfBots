## Data records

The Bot keeps track of the following data:

0. Exception and error handling.

In order to diagnose problems and malfunctions, the Bot writes a log with [exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) into a logfile. User specific information and messages are kept out of these log files as best as possible.

Logs are regularly deleted, if they are no longer needed.

1. User specific settings.

If you use a command to adjust some settings, like `send blockDMs`, the bot will save your discord user ID along with the specified settings.

## Messages and command usage.

Gauss will not keep any record of messages send to it via DMs or in channels it has access to.
The usage of commands is not logged or kept track of in any way.

There is also no analytics or anonymized / pseudonymized data collection.
